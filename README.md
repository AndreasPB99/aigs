# Artificial Intelligence for Simulation and Games

`docs/` contains exercises and notes for the course.
`aigs/` contains code associated with the course and the exercises.
`ludens.py` contains random code snippets that I (Noah) am playing around with.

## Setup

I use [zed.dev](https://zed.dev) as my editor, and recommend you do the same for this course.
In a clean Python virtual environment, install the dependencies with `pip install aigs`.
You should be able to run `.py` scripts in a notebook-like manner in Zed, defining blocks with `# %%` and running them with `Ctrl+Enter`.
If my setup looks intriguing to you, I recommend you check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/syrkis/dotfiles).
I encourage you to fork this repository and make a folder called `my` where you can store your own notes and code snippets.
That way, you can keep your work separate from the course material, and merge in my updates without conflicts.

## Studying

Please follow the official course material.
This repository contains exercises, which you can do,
as well as some of my (Noah's) thoughts on the material.

## Scripts

The scripts in the `aigs` folder are meant to be run in a notebook-like manner.
They are *not* meant to be a library, but rather a collection of useful, unfinished code,
that you can use to understand the concepts in the course.

### Core concept scripts

- `la.py` contains code for linear algebra exercises.
- `o.py` contains code for optimization exercises.
- `nn.py` contains code for neural network exercises.
- `rl.py` contains code for reinforcement learning exercises.
- `mcts.py` contains code for Monte Carlo Tree Search exercises.

### Advanced concept scripts

- `ne.py` contains code for natural evolution exercises.
- `ea.py` contains code for evolutionary algorithms exercises.
- `ma.py` contains code for multi-agent exercises.
- `vae.py` contains code for variational autoencoder exercises.
- `pcg.py` contains code for procedural content generation exercises.
